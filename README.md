## What Is Minishell ? <a href="https://cdn.intra.42.fr/pdf/pdf/65828/en.subject.pdf"> (subject)</a>
Minishell refers to a minimalistic shell or command-line interface program for Unix-like operating systems.A shell is a user interface that allows users to interact with the operating system by executing commandsand managing various tasks. </br>
A Minishell typically provides basic functionality similar to a standard shell, such as executing commands, handling input and output redirection, managing processes, and supporting various shell features like command history and tab completion. However, it may not have all the advanced features of a full-featured shell like Bash or Zsh.

## Parts of a Minishell
The shell implementation is divided into three parts: The Parser, The Executor, and Shell 
Subsystems.  </br>

<h3>1- The Parser</h3>

>The Parser is the software component that reads the command line such as “ls ­-al” and puts it 
into a data structure called Command Table that will store the commands that will be 
executed.

<h3>2- The Executor </h3>

>The executor will take the command table generated by the parser and for every 
SimpleCommand in the array it will create a new process. It will also if necessary create pipes 
to communicate the output of one process to the input of the next one. Additionally, it will 
redirect the standard input, standard output, and standard error if there are any redirections.

<h3>3- Shell Subsystems </h3>

>Other subsystems that complete your shell are: </br>
● Environment Variables: Expressions of the form ``${VAR}`` are expanded with the 
corresponding environment variable. Also the shell should be able to set, expand and 
print environment vars. </br>
● Wildcards: Arguments of the form ``a*a`` are expanded to all the files that match them in 
the local directory and in multiple directories . </br>
● Subshells: Arguments between `` (backticks) are executed and the output is sent as 
input to the shell.
